## Description

Can astronauts orient themselves in space with the compass? The compass has been used
since ancient times for human exploration, but is it useful when we are in orbit around the
Earth? Can we measure the Earth's magnetic field at 400 km in height? Are there
variations in magnetic field when the latitude and longitude varies?
We will try to answer these questions through the data collected by the Raspberry on ISS
and then we will analyze data on Earth and compare them with the data from the World
Magnetic Model (WMM) at 400 km (the altitude of ISS orbit).
If the data of the model will coincide with those collected we could say that it is possible
to correctly measure the Earth's magnetic field from the ISS.
If the result will be positive we will compare the intensity of the magnetic field on the ISS
with that on the Earth's surface.
